Welcome to my GitHub! I hold a **Master’s in Finance from Massey University (2024)** and have a strong background in working with numbers, sharpening **my analytical and problem-solving skills**. I’m passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.

## 🎯 My Goal
I’m actively seeking opportunities to gain hands-on experience, enhance my analytical skills, and deepen my expertise in Power BI and SQL. More importantly, I aim to help businesses extract meaningful insights from data and make informed, data-driven decisions.
